1. Intro multi-panel figure 
- pca diff accessibility among samples (done) 
b) pca diff expression among samples (needed)
- csaw DA results (done)
c) smthng about top variables that contribute to differentiation?
d) unsupervised clustering correlation number DA peaks per species (fig 1b eres et al 2021)?? 


2. chrom state enrichment



2. Homer tfbs enrichment 
- enrichment of tf clusters (done)
- ??
- ??

3. Correlation between gene expression and chromatin accessibility differences (ask irene, her fig is cool)
- correlation da accessibility (pval/fold enrich) and nearby gene expression levels??

4. enrichment of long-range interactions between elements in DA peaks vs elements in non-da peaks????

5. enrichment peaks chromstate nearby lncRNAs TSSs and sequence content
- proportion peaks nearby lncRNA per species (supp?)
- heatmap enrichment across chromstates
- are these lncRNAs DE?
- higher logFC peaks near lncRNA/read cpm between lncRNA peaks and non-lcRNA peaks

6. phyloP conservation 
-  conservation across peak range quantiles 
-  differences in conservation between peaks at enhancers/promoters or at different chrom states 




Supp figures

Supp.1 some sort of QC figure for peak calling e.g.:
* number peaks per species
* peaks distribution around genomic features (done)
* peak distribution around TSS (done)
* tfbs peak enrichment da vs non-da around chromatin states (for peaks NOT near orth genes)
* GC content lncRNA peaks (done)
* enrichment U1 motif 500bp up/downstream the peaks nearby lncRNA TSSs vs all other peaks? 

btw here are 2 folders with some figs that i've generated after the discussion we had yesterday. 
I wll update the google doc once we agree on one but to recap once i liftovered back and forth the consensus peaks I:
1) converted all peaks in hg38; 
2) labelled those peaks that overlap between the two sets as "common" and those which dont as "species-specific"; 
3) converted back the chimp peaks into pantro5; 
4) counted reads overlap in common and species specific peaks (separately for each species) ; 
5) for the common peaks if a human peak corresponds to 2 chimp peaks i merged the counts for the two chimp peaks; 
6) then followed normal edgeR pipeline (wll add detals in the doc)

the folder da_only_common_peaks contains fig generated by retaining only the peaks that are in common and counting the number of reads overlapping only these peaks 
the other folder instead includes both species-specific and common peaks.

I have conflicting opinions on this. I'd keep the results of the da_common_species_specific_regions folder becasue they are comprehensive of all peaks. 
The problem is that PCA will clearly group individuals by species because of the presence of the species-specific peaks (the relative matrix rows for these peaks will be 6x0 +  6x(n overlaps)).
And the same will appear in the MA, volcano plot as well as all the other density plots (these latter look a bit ugly because of these peaks).
If this is not a problem then what we could do in terms of analyses is to carry on comparing common and species-specific peaks 
(e.g. looking for differences in tfbs binding, seq conservation, chrom state and stuff) and then as a subsection
we could look more into those common peaks that are DA between species and see if they are associated with DE genes and stuff like that.
